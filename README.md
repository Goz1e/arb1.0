Arby 1.0 is a Triangular Arbitrage aggregator with support for crypto exchanges(surface arbitrage opportunities)

__METHODOLOGY:__
STEP 0: The Algorithm sorts the price ticker to compile a list of unique arbitrage pairs
then goes on to save this data. the output is an array of unique pairs similar to the data below
[{BTCETH, BTCUSDT, USDT_ETH},...].

STEP 1: get the latest prices for each pair in the returned array from step-0 and pretend-trade the orderbook of pairs checking for positive
values which are returned to the user.

__DESIGN CHOICES:__ 

==> i opted to skip the STEP-0 by hosting the the returned data for each exchange on AWS S3, this enables the Arby focus 
    on getting latest prices and calculating arbitrage opportunities
    
==> i implementated 0Auth authentication for an easy onboarding process

==> i chose Redoc API over swagger UI documentatin just because it looks better ðŸ˜Ž

==> implemented a throttle of 50 API calls /day just because i can ðŸ’ª


__LESSONS FROM PROJECT:__

==> better my understanding of working with APIs

==> enhance my knowledge of django Rest Framework and it's API documentation processes

==> utilization of AWS s3 buckets
